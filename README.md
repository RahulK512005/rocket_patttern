### Rocket Pattern Generator

This Python script, `rocket.py`, generates a unique rocket ship pattern in the console. The program prompts the user to enter a number, `n`, which determines the size and complexity of the rocket's design.

#### How to Use
1.  **Run the script**: Execute the `rocket.py` file from your terminal.
2.  **Enter a number**: The program will ask for an integer input.
3.  **View the pattern**: The script will then print a custom rocket pattern based on the number you provided.

#### Code Breakdown
The script is structured into four main parts:

1.  **Rocket Body Top**: The first loop generates the pointed top of the rocket, which is a triangular shape made of asterisks.
2.  **Rocket Body Middle**: The second loop creates the main, rectangular body of the rocket.
3.  **Fins**: The third loop generates the fins on the side of the rocket's body.
4.  **Exhaust**: The final loop forms the exhaust flame at the bottom of the rocket.
